# Anagrams #

Exercise found in [www.csharpstar.com](https://www.csharpstar.com/csharp-algorithms/) for strings manipulation.

## Goal ##

The goal was to make a program which check if the second string is an anagram to the first string.
Both strings are selected by the user.
I have used a dictionnary to save each key based on a new letter found in the first string.
Then, I am checking if each character from the second string is in the dictionnary.
If so, then the message anagram is shown to the terminal.
If not the message there are not anagrams to the terminal.
